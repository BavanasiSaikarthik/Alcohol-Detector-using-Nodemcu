# Alcohol-Detector-using-Nodemcu
This an iot project. In this project we used Nodemcu Wifi module, along with Nodemcu we used mq3 alcoholic sensor to detect the alcohol level in air. Once alcohol level crosses the threshold value then buzzer rings. In this project we also send the the data to the web browser here Nodemcu acts as a Web server.
